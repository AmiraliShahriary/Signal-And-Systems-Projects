## CA1: Introduction, Linear Regression and Distance Estimation 
Implementation of linear regression and gradient descent.

Estimating distance using template matching. By shifting the sent signal and calculating the correlation between it and the received signal we can estimate the distance of an object. To simulate real situations, a normal-distributed noise will be added.

## CA2: Vehicle Registration Plate Detection and OCR 
This project has two main parts:

letters of a vehicle plate detection(OCR) this is done with template matching. Calculating the correlation of the prepared dataset and letters.

vehicle plate detection This can be done by edge detection, template matching, color diagrams, or a mixed solution.

details can be seen in report.pdf.

## CA3: Encoding Text in Image and Image Detection
Encoding a message in an image by creating a map set, bit string, etc.

## CA4: Encoding Text in Signal and Distance Estimation
This time message will be encoded in signals.

distance estimating is done using convolution.

## CA5: Encoding Text in Signal Using Fourier Transforms
Like previous CA, messages are encoded in signals but they are encoded in Fourier space.

## CA6: Signal Detection
send and receive multiple signals. Detect both the number of received signals and the frequency of them. This is achieved with Fourier transforms.

## CA7: Differential Equations and Simulink
Simulation of differential equations using diagrams in Simulink.
