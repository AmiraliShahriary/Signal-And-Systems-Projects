## CA1: Introduction, Linear Regression and Distance Estimation, Audio Frequency changer
Implementation of linear regression and gradient descent.

Estimating distance using template matching. By shifting the sent signal and calculating the correlation between it and the received signal we can estimate the distance of an object. To simulate real situations, a normal-distributed noise will be added.
Audio Frequency changer that applies different and specific speeds to an audio.

## CA2: Vehicle Registration Plate Detection in Persian & English and OCR 
This project has two main parts:

letters of a vehicle plate detection(OCR) this is done with template matching. Calculating the correlation of the prepared dataset and letters in both Persian and English plates.

vehicle plate detection This can be done by edge detection, template matching, color diagrams, or a mixed solution.

details can be seen in report.pdf.

## CA3: Encoding Text in Image,‫‪Dual-Tone‬‬ ‫‪Multi-Frequency synthesis and analysis,‬‬ and Image Detection
Encoding a message in an image by creating a map set, bit string, etc, and also its decoder.
Dual-tone multi-frequency old Telephone synthesis and analysis that uses correlation and does the desired things.
Image Detector that finds specific IC on a Board and Highlights it.


## CA4: Encoding Text in Signal, Distance Estimation, Customer caller system, and ‫‪diabetes‬‬ Prediction with SVM by using  MATLAB machine learning tools
This time message will be encoded in signals.

distance estimating is done using convolution.
Customer  sound caller system.
diabetes‬‬ Prediction with ‫‪Linear‬‬ SVM (support vector machine)by using  ‫‪the Classification‬‬ ‫‪Learner‬‬ tool.


## CA5: Encoding Text in Signal Using Fourier Transforms
Like previous CA, messages are encoded in signals but they are encoded in Fourier space.

## CA6: Signal Detection, generate Musical notes using Their frequency and the counter
send and receive multiple signals. Detect both the number of received signals and the frequency of them. This is achieved with Fourier transforms.

generate Musical notes using Their frequency and the counter based on Piano system keys (‫‪C‬‬ ‫‪C#‬‬ ‫‪D‬‬ ‫‪D#‬‬ ‫‪E‬‬ ‫‪F‬‬ ‫‪F#‬‬ ‫‪G‬‬ ‫‪G#‬‬ ‫‪A‬‬ ‫‪A#‬‬ ‫‪B‬‬)

## CA7: Differential Equations for Car Damper and Simulink
Simulation of differential equations using diagrams in Simulink.
